To improve:
  ☐ Handle nodes status when it's not ready and we cannot fetch the metrics
  ☐ Handle the Local cluster since metrics cannot be fetched from it
  ☐ Group metrics nodes by cluster (?)


Deployment:
  ☐ Create a Dockerfile for the application
  ☐ Publish the Dockerfile to a public repository
  ☐ Create the Kubernetes deployment manifest
